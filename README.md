# BirdNET Tiny Forge Korvo2 template

This project is a template to be used with the [BirdNET tiny forge](https://github.com/birdnet-team/BirdNET-Tiny-Forge)

At the current stage, it's just a slightly generalized version of the [tensorflow lite micro microspeech example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/blob/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/micro_speech/README.md), modified to templatize some of the settings (see the `main/*.jinja` files).
